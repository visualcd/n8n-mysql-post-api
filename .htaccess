# Security Best Practice: Restrict File System Permissions
# In addition to the .htaccess rule below, it's crucial to set restrictive file system
# permissions for the 'n8napiconfig.php' file. This provides an additional layer of security
# in case .htaccess processing is disabled, misconfigured, or bypassed.
#
# Recommended permissions:
#   chmod 400 n8napiconfig.php  (Owner read-only, no access for group or others)
#   chmod 440 n8napiconfig.php  (Owner read-only, group read-only, no access for others)
#
# Ensure the file is owned by the appropriate user (e.g., your web server user or a dedicated
# deployment user) and group. The choice between 400 and 440 depends on whether the web
# server process itself needs to read the file directly or if it's included by PHP which
# might run as a different user that is part of the file's group. For PHP scripts that include
# the config, the user PHP runs as needs read access.
#
# This .htaccess rule denies direct HTTP access to the configuration file.
